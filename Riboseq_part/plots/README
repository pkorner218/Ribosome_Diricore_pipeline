This package contains the software of the diricore package. While it can be
run stand-alone, it is meant to be used in conjunction with the diricore
docker image and genomic data package (for usage instructions see the
documentation in the diricore package). Especially the driver scripts (*.sh
files) assume certain directory structures. Furthermore certain dependencies
are required to run the software, which are provided by the docker image
(again, for details see the documentation of the diricore package).
